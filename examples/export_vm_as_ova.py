# This example shows how to export a virtual machine as a Virtual
# Appliance (OVA) file to a specified path on a host.

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = sdk.Connection(
    url='https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
    username='admin@internal',
    password='redhat123',
    ca_file='/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem',
    debug=True,
    log=logging.getLogger(),
)

# Find the virtual machine:
vms_service = connection.system_service().vms_service()
vm = vms_service.list(search='name=myvm')[0]
vm_service = vms_service.vm_service(vm.id)

# Find the host:
hosts_service = connection.system_service().hosts_service()
host = hosts_service.list(search='name=myhost')[0]

# Export the virtual machine. Note that the 'filename' parameter is
# optional, and only required if you want to specify a name for the
# generated OVA file that is different from <vm_name>.ova.
# Note that this operation is only available since version 4.2 of
# the engine and since version 4.2 of the SDK.
vm_service.export_to_path_on_host(
    host=types.Host(id=host.id),
    directory='/tmp',
    filename='myvm2.ova'
)

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close()
