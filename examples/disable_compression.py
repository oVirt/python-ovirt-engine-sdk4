import logging

import ovirtsdk4 as sdk

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, filename='example.log')

# This example shows how to disable compression of the responses sent by
# the server:

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = sdk.Connection(
    url='https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
    username='admin@internal',
    password='redhat123',
    ca_file='ca.pem',
    compress=False,
    debug=True,
    log=logging.getLogger(),
)

# By disabling compression you can debug the communication,
# as communication will be visible in plain text and won't
# be raw compressed. Note that compression is automatically
# disabled in case user pass debug parameter set to `true`.

# Get some data:
api = connection.system_service().get()
print(api.product_info.version.full_version)

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close()
