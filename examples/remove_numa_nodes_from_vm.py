# This example will connect to the server and update the description of
# a virtual machine:

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = sdk.Connection(
    url='https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
    username='admin@internal',
    password='redhat123',
    ca_file='ca.pem',

# Get the reference to the virtual machines service:
vms_service = connection.system_service().vms_service()

# Retrieve the description of the virtual machine:
vm = vms_service.list(search='name=myvm')[0]

# In order to update the virtual machine we need a reference to the service
# tht manages it:
vm_service = vms_service.vm_service(vm.id)

# Get the reference to the numa nodes service of the virtual machine:
vm_nodes_service = vm_service.numa_nodes_service()

# For each numa node of the virtual machine we call the remove method
# to remove the numa node. Note that we must remove the numa nodes from
# highest numa node index to lowest numa node index:
for node in sorted(
    vm_nodes_service.list(), key=operator.attrgetter('index'), reverse=True
):
    print("Removing node with id '%s'" % node.id)
    vm_node_service = vm_nodes_service.node_service(node.id)
    vm_node_service.remove()

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close()
