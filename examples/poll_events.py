# in persistent storage the index of the last event that we processed.
# In this example we will store it in a 'index.txt' file. In a real
# world application this should proably be saved in a database.

# If there is no index stored yet, then retrieve the last event and
# start with it. Events are ordered by index, ascending, and 'max=1'
# requests just one event, so we will get the last event.

# waiting a bit before repeating. Note the use of the 'from' parameter
# to specify that we want to get events newer than the last index that
# we already processed. Note also that we don't use the 'max' parameter
