# Create the connection to the server:

    username='admin@internal',
    password='redhat123',

# Find the host:
hosts_service = connection.system_service().hosts_service()
host = hosts_service.list(search='name=myhost')[0]

# Follow the link to the statistics and print their names and values:
stats = connection.follow_link(host.statistics)
for stat in stats:
    print('%s: %s' % (stat.name, stat.values[0].datum))

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close()
