# This example demonstrates how to use multiple connections, using the
# connection builder class and the Python "with" mechanism.

# Multiple connections can be created just calling the constructor
# multiple times, but then it is necessary to store the connection
# parameters somewhere. The "ConnectionBuilder" class simplifies it a
# bit, as it servers at the place to store these parameters:
builder = sdk.ConnectionBuilder(
    url='https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
    username='admin@internal',
    password='redhat123',
    ca_file='ca.pem',
    debug=True,
    log=logging.getLogger(),
)

# Creating the connection builder doesn't do anything, it just stores
# the parameter. To actually create the connection it is necessary to
# call the "build" method, and it is very convenient to combine this
# with the "with" mechanism of Python:
with builder.build() as connection:
    for vm in connection.system_service().vms_service().list():
        print(vm.name)

# The connection has been closed automatically. If there is the need to
# create another connection, the builder object can be reused:
with builder.build() as connection:
    for host in connection.system_service().hosts_service().list():
        print(host.name)
