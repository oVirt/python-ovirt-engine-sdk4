    username='admin@internal',
    password='redhat123',

# Find the host:
host = hosts_service.list(search='name=myhost')[0]

# Find the service that manages the host:
host_service = hosts_service.host_service(host.id)

# If the host isn't down or in maintenance then move it to maintenance:
if host.status != types.HostStatus.MAINTENANCE:
    host_service.deactivate()

# Remove the host:
host_service.remove()

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close()
