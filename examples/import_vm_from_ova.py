# This example shows how to import an external virtual machine from an

# Create a connection to the server:
connection = sdk.Connection(
    url='https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
    username='admin@internal',
    password='redhat123',

# Get the reference to the service that manages import of external
# virtual machines:
system_service = connection.system_service()
imports_service = system_service.external_vm_imports_service()

# Initiate the import of virtual machine 'myvm' from the OVA file. Note
# that the .ova file needs to be previously copied to a place where the
# selected host (the 'myhost' host in this case) can read it. Make also
# sure that the 'vdsm' user can read it. To do so the easier way is to
# change the ownership of the directory:
#
#  chown --recursive 36:36 /myvms
#
# The 'drivers_iso' is necessary when importing a Windows virtual
# machine, and the .iso file has to be uploaded to the ISO storage
# domain before trying to import the virtual machine.
#
# If something fails during the import there will be useful information
# in the '/var/log/vdsm/import' directory of the selected host.
