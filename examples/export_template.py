    username='admin@internal',
    password='redhat123',

system_service = connection.system_service()

# Find the virtual machine template:
templates_service = system_service.templates_service()
template = templates_service.list(search='name=mytemplate')[0]

# Export the virtual machine template. Note that the 'exclusive'
# parameter is optional, and only required if you want to overwrite
# a virtual machine template that has already been exported before.
